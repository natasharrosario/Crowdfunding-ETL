# Crowdfunding-ETL

For this project, I used data from a hypothetical crowdfunding platform for funding independent projects or ventures. I was able to extract and transform the data from the large Excel file into four separate CSV files, 
create a PostgreSQL database and tables by using an ERD, load the new CSV files into the database, and perform SQL queries to generate reports for stakeholders.

Later, I performed both an ETL process and a SQL data analysis on a new dataset that contains information about the backers whoâ€™ve pledged to the live projects. I used Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks to do the extract and transform phases.

This repository includes 1) Python code I used to clean and transform the data, 2) CSV files containing information about the crowdfunding campaigns, backers and their contact information, the campaigns' lead contact information, and lists of the categories and subcategories of campaigns, and 3) a PNG file of the ERD I created to illustrate the relationships between the different tables.
